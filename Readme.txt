JED (James EDitor)

A work in progress to create an object oriented terminal text editor in c++.
Built using MVC "pattern".

Hypothetically in the future new "View" subclasses can be created and swapped in.
This opens the door to JED having its own GUI.

Originally a spin off of a spin off of the Kilo text editor:
